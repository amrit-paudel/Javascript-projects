here java script files are 2 
in first one i do by very simple method
in 2 i use two important things
   1) i use dataset property
   2) i use .filter() instead of .map() because
       when there are objects inside the array it
       is better to use .filter() property because .map()
       method might not return us array
       and latter we might need to do return new_array_data.push(item);
