smooth scroll

Algorithm of smooth scrolling
1) getting all the links 
2) preventing the default properties within them 
3) getting the required section element attached with the links 
4) getting the top position of all those section element 
5) using window.scroll to and putting the required coordinates.
// let say on clicking to the link and after going to the corresponding section element
   we want to close the menu tab . close inside that click function 
6) if something like nav bar is present then we need to substract that
   height from the top position to get the precise top-position  of the sectiion container .

next time correct the nav height and also fix the problem of small screen
