1) Visual code emmets are really helpful 
  like div.number.number$*12{$}*12
2) transform: rotate(--rotation);
  here --rotation is a css variable but we can set it's value from the java script.


DOM_Element.style.setProperty("property_name",value);
  here css property is set in the inlinc but don't know how is rotate() function in external style sheet is getting the 
  --rotation value set in the inline style.

3) calc( ) it is a nice function in css
