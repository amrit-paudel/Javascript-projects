1) when ever an object is created from the class first of all it's constructor 
function is called so if we call another function inside the constructor same function is also called.
2) so we can set all the required variables like 
   this.variable _name='';
   this.variable_name='';
empty or any first default value to another function and can call that function in constructor function
just like we did in clear function in this project .

 3) I FOUND THAT I FORGET TO WRITE 'this' IN FRONT OF VARIABLES WHILE WORKING IN CLASS

 4) using 'defer' can be helpful some times 
  i.e  <script src="app.js" defer> </script>
